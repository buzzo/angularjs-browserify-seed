# crud-js-boilerplate
My first experiment with Nodejs.

Goals:
- no grunt, gulp or builder = pure npm
- no requirejs or AMD = browserify
- after some research I choose the most used structural framework = angularjs
- modular and scalable project = features app folder. Each feature has it's own html/css/js
- project should be easy to code = watchify + browserify
 
TODO:
- add tests
- add production build lifecycle
- add CRUD example
 
start using:
- npm install
- npm run serve (development - open browser http://localhost:3000 and change the code)
